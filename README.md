## ChipDogs App
My solution is implemented using MVVM architecture.
The UI uses a master/detail pattern to display the images in a 2 column grid on iPads or a single column list on iPhones.

The breed list uses a collapsable DisclosureGroup to display the subbreeds and can be searched by breed.

The images are displayed in card views that include a sharelink to share the image and tapping an image will display it fullscreen.

The app also includes unit tests for the view model classes.
