## ItsDogs App
The app allows uses to view and share images of dogs access from https://dog.ceo dog api. 
My solution is implemented using MVVM architecture.
The UI uses a master/detail pattern to display the images in a 2 column grid on iPads or a single column list on iPhones.

The breed list uses a collapsable DisclosureGroup to display the subbreeds and can be searched by breed.

The images are displayed in card views that include a sharelink to share the image and tapping an image will display it fullscreen.
